This is the goal of aenima, following the steps of meteor and express\r\nbut holding on to our beloved and old friend apache and adding some layers.\r\n\r\n<h2>But why?</h2>\r\n\r\nWorking with or in realtime apps makes you forget about rendering views server-side, the goal is\r\nto load all in the client, accessing a restful api, this way we can preserve the functionality of many js plugins\r\nthat we all use to make our apps (datatables, datagrid, isotope, d3js, etc) and remain the dom accesibility of this\r\nre-rendered elements.... Or at least thats what I tell myself so I can keep on working on it :)\r\n\r\n<h2>Can I help?</h2>\r\nThis is a one and a half men operation, any help, feedback and support is welcome! contact by mail\r\nb3n0ns@gmail.com\r\n\r\n<h2>Whats the vision of aenima?</h2>\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make an unobtrusive framework that allows you to make your work and just gives you a way to achieve\r\nthe functionality that we want, and eventually allow us to build apps that haves a mix of this big, larger than life \r\nfriends:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n   <li>amazon</li>\r\n   <li>twitter</li>\r\n   <li>facebook</li>\r\n   <li>wizpert</li>\r\n   <li>wordpress</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nHow far can we push the  user-server interaction?
